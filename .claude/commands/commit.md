# Commit Changes

Run `/assess` first, then if passed, create a commit.

## Instructions

1. First run the assess checks (documentation, test coverage, tests)
2. If assess passes, show `git status` and `git diff --stat`
3. Generate commit message based on changes
4. Stage relevant files and commit with Co-Authored-By

## Important

- NEVER use --no-verify flag
- Only commit when explicitly asked
- Use descriptive commit messages focusing on "why" not "what"
